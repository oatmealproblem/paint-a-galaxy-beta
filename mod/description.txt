Paint your very own galaxy and play in it!

[h1]IMPORTANT: read the instructions[/h1]

This mod does [b]nothing[/b] on it's own. You use it alongside [url=https://oatmealproblem.github.io/paint-a-galaxy]the Paint a Galaxy web app[/url].

[olist]
  [*] Subscribe to and activate this mod
  [*] Paint, generate stars and hyperlanes, and download the txt file in [url=https://oatmealproblem.github.io/paint-a-galaxy]the web app[/url]
  [*] Open this mod's folder
  [list]
    [*] Find this mod in your "Mod Library" in the launcher (there's a search at the top)
    [*] Hover over the mod and click the 3 dots to the right, then click "Show in Folder"
  [/list]
  [*] Open the folder "map", and inside "map" open the folder "setup_scenarios" (you should now be in the folder containing a file named "PUT_YOUR_GALAXY_HERE")
  [*] Copy the txt file you downloaded to the "setup_scenarios" folder
  [list]
    [*] Note: if you ever unsubscribe from this mod, your custom galaxies will be deleted, so you might want to keep a copy elsewhere
    [*] Alternatively, you can create your own mod; see the instructions in the pinned discussion
  [/list]
  [*] Run the game, and select "Painted Galaxy" (or whatever name you chose in the app) as your galaxy size when starting a new game
  [list]
    [*] I recommend that you do not use Imperial Fiefdom, Broken Shackles, or Payback origins. See known bugs below.
      [*] I recommend disabling this mod if you're not playing on a painted galaxy (the fixes I make for static galaxies could cause bugs in random galaxies)
  [/list]
[/olist]

[h1]Known Bugs (will fix)[/h1]
[list]
  [*] None! but see caveats and compatibility below, and please report any issues find
[/list]

[h1]Caveats (minor issues, won't fix / not fixable)[/h1]
[list]
  [*] Large galaxies (roughly 1700+ stars) require a mod that adds more star names (such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907769573]Just Star Names[/url])
  [*] Sol doesn't get Sol-specific neighbors, eg Alpha Centauri, Barnard's Star
  [*] The "Advanced Neighbors" galaxy setting has no effect (if advanced AI empires are enabled, they can neighbor the player)
  [*] All precursors are "on" regardless of galaxy settings (but the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039370479]Precursor Selection[/url] does work)
  [*] Some things need to create additional solar systems, so you'll see some in-game that were not in the online map painter (guaranteed worlds, marauders, fallen empires, some events). Some of these are vanilla behavior, some of these are fixes for static galaxies.
  [*] Force spawning custom empires [b]does[/b] work, but they are not listed in the galaxy setup screen
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
  [*] For Stellaris 4.1
  [list]
    [*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3573084816]3.14 patch available here[/url]
  [/list]
  [*] Should be compatible with most mods
  [*] Modded origins that change homeworld planet class or guaranteed habitable worlds might have minor issues; please report if you encounter anything and I will fix for popular mods
  [*] If you are using a mod that adds galaxy shapes, you must select a vanilla shape (eg elliptical) for the Painted Galaxy size option to appear
  [*] Modded precursors are not directly supported, but will work if you use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3039370479]Precursor Selection[/url]
  [*] Mods that edit common/fallen_empires have minor incompatibilities (I only know of Ancient Cache of Technologies and Ethics & Civics: Bug Branch; I will coordinate with these authors to fix)
  [*] Modded event chains that rely on "neighbor_system" initializers will not work. This is generally rare. I have fixed / verified the following mods:
  [list]
    [*] Gigastructural Engineering and More
    [*] More Events Mod
  [/list]
  [*] If you are using a mod that changes the core (eg Gigastructural Engineering), don't paint stars there
[/list]

[h1]Sharing[/h1]
Feel free to share and upload the galaxies you create, and feel free to manually edit them further to your liking. You should mark this mod as required, otherwise your subscribers will experience issues with incorrect homeworlds (I prefer you [b]not[/b] simply copy this mods code into your mod, since that could lead to conflicts if release fixes/updates). Credit and linking is appreciated.
